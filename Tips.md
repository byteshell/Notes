# About Group Policy Preferences

Group Policy Preferences (GPP) was introduced in Windows Server 2008, and among many other features,
allowed administrators to modify users and groups across their network.
An example use case is where a companyâ€™s gold image had a weak local administrator password, and
administrators wanted to retrospectively set it to something stronger. The defined password was AES-256
encrypted and stored in Groups.xml . However, at some point in 2012, Microsoft published the AES key on
MSDN, meaning that passwords set using GPP are now trivial to crack and considered low-hanging fruit.

### Example

We extract the encrypted password form the Groups.xml file and decrypt it using gpp-decrypt .

```
gpp-decrypt
